## 2. Application Modernization - Re-Platform Phase

**Gain valuable insights into applications during application modernization "Assessment" phase. ** 

- [Launch Tutorial: IBM Transformation Advisor - Re-Platform](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/dte/tutorial/cloud-enabled-use-case-modernize-java-apps-using-ibm-transformation-advisor-and-cloud-pak)

<p>
IBM Transformation Advisor bridges the gap between 
existing development activities and cloud-native development together with the ‘Accelerators for Teams’ in 
the IBM Cloud Pak for Applications (ICPA).  Transformation Advisor will accelerate the development process 
by creating the configuration and deployment artifacts for an application, then facilitate the developer’s 
use of the enhanced developer productivity tools in IBM Cloud Pak for Applications.   
</p>

<p> 
This tutorial brings the cloud-native development experience from the “Create and Deploy a Cloud Native App to 
IBM Cloud Pak for Applications (ICPA)” lab, which develops a cloud native microservice application using the 
nodejs-express and java-spring-boot Application Stacks, to the modernization of existing application.
